            "description": "Unit 61398, also known as APT1, is a Chinese state-sponsored cyber espionage actor. Our research indicates that the Communist Party of China (CPC) is tasking the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) to commit systematic cyber espionage and data theft against organizations around the world. Mandiant report indicates that APT1 is likely government-sponsored and one of the most persistent of China\u2019s cyber threat actors, and they believe that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign in large part because it receives direct government support.",
